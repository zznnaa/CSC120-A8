# CSC120-A8: Promises, Promises...

The task for this assignment is simple: create a class that `implement`s the `interface` contained in `Contract.java`... and does something interesting! Pay attention to the method names, and remember that your program should adhere to Java conventions (so each method's behavior should make sense with respect to what its name implies). The rest is up to you. Have fun! :-)
