- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    It represents a crow, who can fly, walk, chew on sticks, and various other things. The grab method allows the crow to add items to its cache (personal inventory). The drop method drops a given item from the cache. The crow can an examine an object by chewing on it. The crow can use an item if it's small enough to hold in its beak. The crow can walk right, left, up, and down or fly to specified location using coordinates. The crow can rest by returning home. The crow can shrink or grow its nest, and the crow can poop on humans' cars.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    A toString method and a getRandomNumber method.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Worked: not that hard of an assignment
    Didn't work: Being behind on other classes didn't leave a lot of time for this assignment, so I had to turn it in late without the additional learning investment I would've liked to put in.
    Advice: College is hard, do your best <3
